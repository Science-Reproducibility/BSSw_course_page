# Best Practices for Reproducibility and Testing in Scientific Software

## Program Overview

The goal of this project is to promote continuous learning, encourage the integration of best practices in scientific software development, and build a collaborative community of scientists through a comprehensive training program.

The individual courses are designed to be self-paced, spanning 3-5 weeks, with a relatively small time commitment of 1-2 hours per week.

Additionally, there will be organized sessions held on a monthly cycle, culminating in a virtual office hour to address questions and provide further support (schedule to be determined).


## Course Prerequisite
We will be using GitHub and GitHub Skills templates during the course, so you shoul create a GitHub account ( https://github.com and follow the “Sign up” link) and I strongly suggest completing two GitHub skills courses:

- [Introduction to GitHub](https://github.com/skills/introduction-to-github)
- [Code with Codespace](https://github.com/skills/code-with-codespaces) (the first 3 steps are enough for this course)

Don't worry you will learn more about the Git during the course!

## Reproducibility in Scientific Software
- [Introduction to Shell](https://github.com/Science-Reproducibility/shell)
- [Introduction to Version Control Systems and Git](https://github.com/Science-Reproducibility/version-control-systems)

## Testing and Debugging with Python
- [Introduction to pytest](https://github.com/Science-Reproducibility/pytest-introduction)
- [Introduction to debugging in Python](https://github.com/Science-Reproducibility/python-debugging)
