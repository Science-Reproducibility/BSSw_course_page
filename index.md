# Best Practices for Reproducibility and Testing in Scientific Software

## Program Overview

The goal of this project is to establish a community of scientists through an seven-months training program, fostering continuous learning and the integration of best practices in scientific software development. 

The course will start in September 2024 and will continue to early 2025. 
Each month we will work on a different module from two main sections, Reproducibility in Scientific Software 
and Testing and Debugging with Python.

At the end of each month a virtual office hour will be offered TBD.

## Course Prerequisite
We will be using GitHub and GitHub Skills templates during the course, so you shoul create a GitHub account ( https://github.com and follow the “Sign up” link) and I strongly suggest completing two GitHub skills courses:

- [Introduction to GitHub](https://github.com/skills/introduction-to-github)
- [Code with Codespace](https://github.com/skills/code-with-codespaces) (the first 3 steps are enough for this course)

Don't worry you will learn more about the Git during the course!

## Reproducibility in Scientific Software
- [Introduction to Shell](https://github.com/Science-Reproducibility/shell)
- [Introduction to Version Control Systems and Git](https://github.com/Science-Reproducibility/version-control-systems)

## Testing and Debugging with Python
- [Introduction to pytest](https://github.com/Science-Reproducibility/pytest-introduction)
- [Introduction to debugging in Python](https://github.com/Science-Reproducibility/python-debugging)
