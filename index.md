# Best Practices for Reproducibility and Testing in Scientific Software

## Program Overview

The goal of this project is to promote continuous learning, encourage the integration of best practices in scientific software development, and build a collaborative community of scientists through a comprehensive training program.

The individual courses are designed to be self-paced, spanning 3-5 weeks, with a relatively small time commitment of 1-2 hours per week.

**You can do the courses on your own time, but starting February 2025 I will offer virtual office hours.

## Course Prerequisite
We will be using GitHub and GitHub Skills templates during the course, so you should create a GitHub account (go to https://github.com and follow the “Sign up” link) and I strongly suggest completing two GitHub skills courses:

- [Introduction to GitHub](https://github.com/skills/introduction-to-github)
- [Code with Codespace](https://github.com/skills/code-with-codespaces) (the first step is enough for this course)

Don't worry, you will learn more about the Git during the course!

## Reproducibility in Scientific Software
- [Introduction to Shell](https://github.com/Science-Reproducibility/shell)
- Introduction to Version Control Systems and Git: *The link will be added soon*

## Testing and Debugging with Python
- Introduction to pytest: *The link will be added soon*
- Introduction to debugging in Python: *The link will be added soon*

## About me and BSSw
